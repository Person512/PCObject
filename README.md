# PCObject
This is a PC object that simulates the workings of a PC. The PC that the program simulates is one that is completely new, thus it only has a few basic programs. The program first asks the user how many PCs they want and stores that in a list. The program will then add up the total cost of the PCs and print it out to the user. Then the user must choose a PC to use and then can apply settings. However as the user is turning on the PC, there is a 30% chance for the computer to crash and thus throw an error. If this happens, the user must restart the whole program to simulate restarting the computer in real life. They can set the date and time according to the specifications of their location. The program also allows the user to add any application that they desire as the basic PC only comes with a few standard applications: Chrome, Bluej, and Firefox. The program will keep asking if the user wants to add more applications until the user responds “false” to the question of “Do you want to add more applications?” Then the boolean will be set to false and the loop will end.
